The user can see the total counts of cases within the data based on various queries such as borough and dates (seasons). Statistical analysis on the data further shows percentages of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by borough per season as well as comparing percentages of those who tested positive and died of COVID-19, those who tested positive and admitted themselves to the hospital, and those who admitted themselves to the hospital and subsequently died from COVID-19.
